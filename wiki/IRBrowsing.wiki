#summary Browsing Compiler IR Dump with Showgraph.

= Dumping IR to file =
=== ICC ===

To dump IR in ICC use the following command line:
{{{
icc <your src-file> -mP2OPT_il0_print=<num>
}}}
where _num_ is a phase number.<br>
*Stderr* is used as the output stream.<br>
<br>
If _num_ = -1 then the dump will be printed after each phase.<br>
Phase numbering isn't successive, the numbers of phases seem to be chosen at random.<br>
<br>
Numbers of the most useful phases:
  * 6    - after building CFG
  * 2510 - after some optimizations.
<br>
=== GCC ===
ShowGraph supports GCC 4.x and doesn't support GCC 3 dumps. To dump IR in GCC use the following command line:
{{{
gcc <your src-file> -df
}}}
The output will be in src-file.cfg

= Browsing IR =
When IR is dumped you can open dumps file through the `File` menu. !ShowGraph will parse the file and search for routine names. If there are multiple routines in file it will ask you to select routine of interest and then parse it. 

After dump is parsed ShowGraph performs automatic layout and you can see control flow graph in main window. It can be zoomed and panned.

Double click on a node will show its textual representation in !dockable window. Textual representation has !clickable node numbers so that user could browse it like a set of hyperlinked pages. 

Note that in IR browsing mode double click behaves differently from editor mode. However if you want you can enable edition through context menu which is shown by right-clicking on graph background.
