#summary ShowGraph user's manual.

= Introduction =
There is no _real_ manual for showgraph, but this wiki pages describe most features that you will need editing graphs.

ShowGraph can be used in two ways:
  # Graph Editor/Viewer
  # IR viewer

Using ShowGraph as an editor one can create diagrams and graphs and export them as pictures. Showgraph saves its graphs in simple XML-derived format. These XML files can be generated by other software in order to use ShowGraph as a viewer.

Using ShowGraph as IR viewer one can open compiler IR dumps and browse them. This makes sense for compiler developers or students.
