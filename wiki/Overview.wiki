= Graph Editor =
    Showgraph tool is a simple graph editor/viewer. It allows for creating nodes and connecting them with edges. Nodes have ediatable labels and edges can be routed using control points. One of primary goals was to create lightweight and easy-to-use tool for fast construction of a graph's visual representation. Nodes are simply created by double-click on background and edges are created by pressing right mouse button on one node, holding it down while moving to other node and finally releasing it on the target node. Nodes can be moved around by simply dragging them.
